# GGJ-2023
My submission for the 2023 Global GameJam.

In this game you control the roots of a tree and you try to stop an invasion of dwarfs.

### How to play

Just use your mouse to click. By clicking on a terrain tile near a root tile, you can grow roots.

You have 2 types of roots:
- regular roots, that you spawn by clicking ground tiles of a lighter color. They generate points that you can spend on more roots. Try to surround them with as much ground as you can to maximise there point output.
- spiked roots, that you spawn by clicking empty tiles (ground tiles of a darker color). They damage dwarf when they mine them.

All roots cost points to place. They also have maintenance cost every turn. So don't overexpand. If you have less than 0 points to grow roots and will lose point on next turn, you lose the game.

Dwarfs are pretty dumb. They will mine anything around them and if they can't find something else to mine.

### Goal

Kill all dwarfs.

### Credits

I used some assests from this pack https://kenney.nl/assets/rpg-base

Everything else (aside from the Unity engine) I made myself.
